## About

This is a new form of my existing Agents Library in response to much of my workflow using llama.cpp more.
This is a client side helper for running models from a llama.cpp server.

Please see the various demo files to see how to use the features of the library.
This library is not a pip package yet so Agents2.py will need to be in the same directory as the rest of the code.

This project will be periodically updated.
Any feedback, suggestions, or collaboration is welcome!

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Rohan-Bhargava/Agents2.git
cd Agents2
```
